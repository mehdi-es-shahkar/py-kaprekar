Kap Rekar is the name of an Indian mathematics enthusiast. If we arrange the digits of a four-digit number once from the largest to the smallest digit and once again from the smallest to the largest digit and subtract the larger number from the smaller number, in one or finally seven steps, we reach the Karpakar number (6174). If we do not reach this number in the first step, we consider the result of subtracting two numbers and do the same as the previous step to reach the effective number.
